<h1>Alice and Zooks</h1>

<p>
Round the notsoround (mostly jagged) rock of swiveling shoally shore of the
stream-not-yet-a-river in banded banter Alice and Zooks juanted along most
merrily, to fritter away the times of their youth in a not unfounded fear of it
passing away, or of it becoming something else entirely.
</p>

<p>
"Pictures go into eyes, and words come out of the mouth, but they both go
through the head, which is why we can say things that refer to things."
</p>

<p>
"But whats in the head doing all that translating work? Seems awfully difficult
to me; I doubt I could do it if I set me mind upon it. And besides be that for
you the last time your head rattled around it sounded hollower than me
grandmother's bone marrow."
</p>

<p>
"But I spoke just before and you understood, verily so? Twould be a twiddle of
muppery muffins and then some if not!"
</p>

<p>
"Twould be, but twas a ghost that brought our bodies here to this stream, the
oeuvre of the day and of our heads!"
</p>

<p>
With that the young Jungians of symbol galore brught theemselves forthswitcht to a
moorish mood, for they remembered that streams always turn to rivers lest they
run dry and fizzle to fuzz, and their filosophistical theories, the prowess and
profundity withwhich they betwixt them teenselves (though they be not more than
twelve and three quarters years or age) to surely be proof thereof. Yet theory
doesn't get one much farther than where one is always byandbye starting thereie,
which is why they forgot abot rivers going to oceans and then coming backtowhich
arond by way of tempertural or occult circumnavigation of the sky to feed fronds
or to be streams wunce again. By this reason twoo scientists have forgotten
about the application of science to nonscientific things, the rivers of their
work being pathways too grounded for water to evaporate off their regular
surfaces, even at the highest points of their tidal motion. Alas these two are
influential in their fields. But let us curl the stream of antipurposeful
digress to regress back upon itself to return to the subject(s) of Alice and
Zooks. They were not much in the way of scientists.
