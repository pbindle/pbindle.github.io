<h2>The Necroscholastic</h2>
<span>Jun 10, 2020</span>
<p>
I am not a scholastic. I am a necroscholastic. The scholars of our traditions
and histories, those upon which we are expected to comment or expound (and
today there is really only commentary) does not need to be reconciled with
anything, but rather resurrected. Born again in our own image. It is not my
intention to be particular to the intention of any author &mdash; which was the
vanity of the neoplatonists to reconcile Plato and Aristotle, which was the vanity
of the positivists to incorporate the mystical Wittgenstein into themselves
&mdash; but rather to construct my own meaning, my own figure of the past.

<h2>The Dashboard</h2>
<h3>Its Etymology and Function</h3>
<span>Feb 3, 2020</span>
<p>
When hearing the word "dashboard", perhaps two definitions spring to mind. The
first and most common is the dashboard of a car, with its instruments that
provide important but secondary information. The primary information being that
which is on the road itself, as of course it is more important when one is
driving that they do not hit the other cars on the road, rather than obey the speed limit
to the specific digit. The other definition is the dashboard of a web app or similar,
which provides some condensed information about some system or service so
that it can be monitored. How truly useful that information is in a specific
dashboard is variable, many professionals relying heavily on some specific
dashboard, others being keenly aware that such-and-such a dashboard is utterly
useless.
